## To Do
- [ ] Timestamps not displaying in chronological order (see Neuro 1 on Wednesday)
- [ ] Move NM outpatient CT coverage to 1 PM
- [ ] Add switch on front page to toggle between Rotation and Coverage interfaces
- [ ] Coverage interface does need to update available tree options to make it easier to navigate.
- [ ] Enable selecting "All" in coverage interface? Would need a much more complicated display. Maybe a tree (a lot like the old spreadsheet)
- [ ] Fractional displays don't look right.
