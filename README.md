## To Do
- [ ] Coverage interface does need to update available tree options to make it easier to navigate.
- [ ] Enable selecting "All" in coverage interface? Would need a much more complicated display. Maybe a tree (a lot like the old spreadsheet)
- [ ] Put modalities in exam categorizations so coverage queries don't need to input modality.
- [ ] Cached jsons need to be updated if the source is changed. How to do with static files?
