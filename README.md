## To Do
- [x] Timestamps not displaying in chronological order (see Neuro 1 on Wednesday)
- [x] Move NM outpatient CT coverage to 1 PM
- [x] Add switch on front page to toggle between Rotation and Coverage interfaces
- [ ] Coverage interface does need to update available tree options to make it easier to navigate.
- [ ] Enable selecting "All" in coverage interface? Would need a much more complicated display. Maybe a tree (a lot like the old spreadsheet)
- [x] Fractional displays don't look right.
- [ ] Put modalities in exam categorizations so coverage queries don't need to input modality.
